# 👋 Hey there! I'm [Your Name]  

🚀 Full-stack developer | ⚡ Physics Enthusiast | 🎨 E-commerce Architect  

## About Me  
- 👩‍💻 I specialize in **MERN stack** and have a love-hate relationship with `console.log()`  
- 🛍️ Currently building an **e-commerce platform** that’s more than just a store—it's a **forum, a marketplace, and a learning hub** all in one!  
- 🔬 **Physics meets code**—I created a **physics solver** using ChatGPT API, trained on a **Hugging Face dataset**, with a sprinkle of **multithreading magic** ✨  
- 🎓 Survived **parallel computing, graph theory, and six midterms at once** (barely)  
- 🎯 If you see me in VS Code at 3 AM, no you don’t.  

## What I’m Working On  
🔹 **Tamkeen**: Empowering talented women in Pakistan through an e-commerce platform  
🔹 **PhysiQ**: Web app that visualizes electric fields and calculates physics formulas  
🔹 **Forum System**: Implementing **upvotes, downvotes, and threaded replies** because discussions need structure!  

## Fun Facts  
- 🎨 Choosing the perfect color scheme for Tamkeen is **harder than debugging**  
- 🏋️‍♀️ Trying to hit the gym at least **3x a week** (send help)  
- 🤯 Short attention span but still somehow juggling multiple projects
